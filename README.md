## üèÅ Getting Started (to run game locally)

Follow the steps below, after cloning the repository:

### üñê Requirements

**For Installing:**

- Node

**For Running:**

- Change socket.IO endpoint on client side. To do this, go to `client/src/components/Game.js` and change line #26 from `const ENDPOINT = 'https://uno-online-multiplayer.herokuapp.com/'` to `const ENDPOINT = 'http://localhost:5000'`

### ‚è≥ Installation

- At the root of the project directory, use npm to install the server-side dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all the server-side dependencies needed for the game to run locally.

- Use npm to run server

```bash
npm start
```

This command gets the server running on localhost port 5000.

- In a separate terminal, navigate into the client folder and use npm to install the client-side dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

This command installs all the client-side dependencies needed for the game to run locally.

- Finally, use npm to run client

```bash
npm start
```

This command gets the client running on localhost port 3000.

Head over to http://localhost:3000/ and enjoy the game! üéâ
